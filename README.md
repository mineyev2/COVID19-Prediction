# COVID19-Prediction
Still in progress

Currently have a logistic curve for prediction of the virus given current trajectory.
Current Issues: 
* How would self-quarantines, lockdowns, social distancing affect this graph? Wuhanese people are going back to work after recent lockdown. How would such factors affect this graph? 
* The Logistic curve is ill posed, fitting SIR/SEIR model in progress.
* Can we use a PDE model to predict the spread over a world map?
