# COVID19-Prediction
Still in progress

Currently have a logistic curve and SIR model for prediction of the virus given current trajectory.
Current Issues:  
* For the SIR Model
  * Put constraints on beta and gamma using interpolants
  * Interactive graph to see how the graph will responds to jumps in removal or infection rates.
* Potential SIRD, SEIR, or SEIRD model. SIRD should be simple given that SIR has already been done
* Can we use a PDE model to predict the spread over a world map?
