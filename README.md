# COVID19-Prediction
Still in progress

Currently have a logistic curve, SIR, and SIRD model for prediction of the virus given current trajectory.
Current Issues:  
* For the SIRD Model
  * Interactive graph to see how the graph will responds to jumps in removal or infection rates.
* Potential SEIR, or SEIRD model.
* Can we use a PDE model to predict the spread over a world map?
